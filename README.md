**Questions:**

    Which states generally have the best and worst health with nutrition, physical activity, and obesity?

    Which states did better over the years? And which did worse?

    Which states enacted the most legislation? And the least?
    
    For the states that enacted the most legislation, did they have better health outcomes that year or the following year? 

**Sources:**
1. Nutrition, physical activity, and obesity health behaviors: 
    https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity/Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity-Behavioral/hn4x-zwk7
    (At the time of the project, the data included the years 2011-2020)
    
2. Legislation regarding nutrition, physical activity, and obesity:
    https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity/CDC-Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity-Legisl/nxst-x9p4
    (At the time of the project, the data included the years 2001-2017)
    
    Because of the preference of source (1), I joined the data to include all of source (1) but only the years from source (2) that overlapped.
    This made my combined dataset span the years 2011-2020.
    
    There are years where no data was gathered for particular questions, notibly nutrition which only appeared in the latter years.
